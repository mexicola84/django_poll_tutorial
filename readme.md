This readme.md does not guide through the project itself, as
the repo is just showing off my progress in following along the
official Django tutorial.

Just started with Python and especially with Django.
Also trying to getting used to Github workflows.
This is my first repo I have personally set up.

Code's nothing special here, just moving along with the tutorials.

Will update as I progress.
